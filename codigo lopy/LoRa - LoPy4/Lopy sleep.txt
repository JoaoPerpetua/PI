-----machine.deepsleep([time_ms])---------------  

 time_ms --- time of sleep. Se 0 fica a dormir ate reset carregado.



-----machine.pin_sleep_wakeup(pins, mode, enable_pull) ---------------------------

Configure pins to wake up from sleep mode. The pins which have this capability are: P2, P3, P4, P6, P8 to P10 and P13 to P23.

The arguments are:

pins --- a list or tuple containing the GPIO to setup for sleep wakeup.
mode --- selects the way the configure GPIOs can wake up the module. The possible values are:
machine.WAKEUP_ALL_LOW
machine.WAKEUP_ANY_HIGH.
enable_pull --- if set to True keeps the pull up or pull down resistors enabled during sleep. If this variable is set to True, then ULP or capacitive touch wakeup cannot be used in combination with GPIO wakeup.
